As a software developer, you know the importance of writing clean and functional code. But even the best code can have bugs, leading to unhappy users and, in some cases, serious consequences. That’s why testing your software is crucial to ensure it works as intended. In this blog post, we’ll dive into the world of API testing using Jest and Supertest. By the end of this guide, you’ll have a solid foundation for testing your Node.js Express application and can feel confident in delivering high-quality, reliable software to your users.

## Installation and Configuration

### Install Jest and Supertest:

```
npm install --save-dev jest supertest

```
### Configure Jest
Open your package.json and add the following configuration for Jest:

```
"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "node",
  "coveragePathIgnorePatterns": ["/node_modules/"]
}

```
This basic configuration ensures that Jest is ready for testing our API. The coveragePathIgnorePatterns specifies a regex to exclude certain directories (e.g., node_modules) from code coverage analysis.

### Write a Simple Test 
Create a new directory called tests and add a file named sample.test.js. Inside this file, write a simple test:

```
describe('GET a product', () => {
  it('get specific product', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('https://productsapi-n5p2.onrender.com/api/v1/products/f3ba4fb4-02ab-4dc7-8e5e-e404b1b0a00c')
      .send(data);

    expect(response.statusCode).toEqual(200);
    expect(response.body.name).toEqual("Fantastic Granite Bike");
  });
});

```
API testing with Jest and Supertest allows you to verify that your endpoints work as expected. By following this guide, you’ll be well-equipped to create robust and reliable APIs. Remember to test thoroughly, handle asynchronous code, and organize your test suites effectively.
